# WILD WILD WEST

## Description

This was an intended exercise to be done as a tutorial for CSCB20 (Introduction to Databases and Web Programming) 

I eventually felt that it would be too difficult for a 2nd-year student who had just learned Javascript to be able to properly code this in an hour so I scrapped it and dumbed it down to a Rock-Paper-Scissors game instead.
Since I don't want the code to go to waste, here it is if someone else decides to use it as a teaching exercise. This example would be a lot better for a web development course where the students are more familiar with
programming and/or with Javascript. Perhaps you could even make them code the entire thing from scratch as well (although the event handling is a little overly simplistic)

The most difficult thing about this exercise is more so the game logic than the actual client-side scripting. Additionally, the code could be optimized into a single function however I wanted to emphasize how the functions
can interact with one another even without being called from the HTML`
